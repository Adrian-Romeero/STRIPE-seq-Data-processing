# STRIPE-seq-Data-processing and TSS detection\n
This repository contains the pipeline for STRIPE-seq to perform TSS detection and DTU analysis( Differential TSS usage).\n
####### STRIPE-seq processing #######\n
The folder "Snake_file" contains the code for processing and alignment for STRIPE-seq Data,\n 
but can be adapted to other TSS detection methods such as CAGE-seq or TSS-seq.\n
####### TSS Detection and DTU #######\n
The folder "TSS analysis" contains the code for:\n
  - TSS detection and annotation (TSS-calling.rmd).\n
  - Differential TSS Use analysis and Differential TSS Gen Expresion analysis (DTU.rmd).\n
  - Estimation of TSS through TCs and plots related to DTU results (Plots.rmd).\n
