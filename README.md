# STRIPE-seq-Data-processing
This repository contains the pipeline for STRIPE-seq to perform TSS detection and DTU analysis( Differential TSS usage).
####### STRIPE-seq processing #######
The folder "Snake_file" contains the code for processing and alignment for STRIPE-seq Data, 
but can be adapted to other TSS detection methods such as CAGE-seq or TSS-seq.
####### TSS Detection and DTU #######
The folder "TSS analysis" contains the code for:
  - TSS detection and annotation (TSS-calling.rmd).
  - Differential TSS Use analysis and Differential TSS Gen Expresion analysis (DTU.rmd).
  - Estimation of TSS through TCs and plots related to DTU results (Plots.rmd)
